Task 1(Supervised Learning) - to predict student performance based on number of study hours
Here in adding the python code for prediction using Ordinary Least squares method

Task 2(Unsupervised Learning) - From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually

Task 6(Decision Tree) - Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
